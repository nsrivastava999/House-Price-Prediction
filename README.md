# House-Price-Prediction
ML model made using Banglore house daataset from Kaggle for predicting house prices in Banglore

I have used the following libraries for this task
  1.Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning 
  2.Matplotlib for data visualization 
  3.Sklearn for model building 
Compared the accuracy for 3 regression based algorithms: Linear Regression, Lasso  Algorithm and Decision Trees.
Got the highest accuracy of 85% with Linear Regression and continued with that only.
